# SentNoB: A Dataset for Analysing Sentiment on Noisy Bangla Texts

This is the implementation of our paper "SentNoB: A Dataset for Analysing Sentiment on Noisy Bangla Texts". You can find the paper [here](http://sudiptakar.info/assets/files/sentnob_emnlp_2021.pdf).

## Abstract
In this paper, we propose an annotated sentiment
analysis dataset made of informally written
Bangla texts. This dataset comprises public
comments on news and videos collected
from social media covering 13 different domains,
including politics, education, and agriculture.
These comments are labeled with one
of the polarity labels, namely positive, negative,
and neutral. One significant characteristic
of the dataset is that each of the comments is
noisy in terms of the mix of dialects and grammatical
incorrectness. Our experiments to develop
a benchmark classification system show
that hand-crafted lexical features provide superior
performance than neural network and pretrained
language models.
